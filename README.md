## :question: What is Infino?

Infino is an observability platform that stores both metrics and application logs together. The key differences between Infino and other tools are:

* It stores metrics and logs together - so you won't need to use two separate systems to store these.
* It is built for focused observability use-case and written in Rust - you will find it faster and more cost-efficient than other tools. See [benchmark](benches/README.md).


## :thinking: Why Infino?

Infino was born out of the frustation of needing two open source systems (such as Prometheus + ELK) for storing metrics and application logs, even though the purpose of these two is the same - i.e., improve obervability and reliability of systems.

When we decided to write an open-source platform that stores both of these together, we built it from the ground up in Rust, with performance (which leads to cost reduction) as **THE** key criteria to focus on. Give us a try if you'd like to store metrics and logs together, and reduce the cost of your observability infrastructure along the way!


## :fire: Features

* Store metrics and logs together,
* Ingest using [FluentBit](https://fluentbit.io/),
* Search logs using boolean *AND* queries,
* Query time series of metrics stored,
* Coming Soon:
  * Store metrics and logs on S3,
  * More integrations: Prometheus, LogStash, and Grafana,
  * Powerful query language for metrics and logs,
  * Performance improvements while searching logs and metrics.
  * Inbuilt queue for disaster recovery - no data loss in case of failures.
  * Clients in other languages - Java, JavaScipt, Python,
  * UI for querying Infino.
  * Support for traces and Spans


## :beginner: Getting started

* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
* Install [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
* TODO: add details regarding make targets.
